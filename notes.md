**This file contains notes and dated documentation I'll keep as I progress through the chess project this semester.**

5 September

- created a github repository (repo) named chess and made it public
- added a license and readme file, as well as this notes file
- made some changes locally, added the file to git, and pushed it up to the repo on the git server
- did it again using this documentation from 5 Sep
